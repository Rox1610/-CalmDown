Project completed during the Web Dev Bootcamp:

9-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp where we learned to work with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript ES6, SQL, git, GitHub, Heroku and Ruby on Rails. We worked in a team to design, implement and ship our product to help people to deal with stress before a presentation.

The following* features were implemented in the app. Here is the user story timeline.

 - The first time you connect, a quiz is displayed to determine your personality* profile  (auditive, visual):

-When the user completed the quizz, he/she is able to add an event to the calendar. A personalised program is also generated based on the profile and the timing of the event. Links to audio/video library and a cardiac coherence exercise are also available:

- The user can rate an event via an emoji scale and then consult the dashboard to view his/her progression (event rating over time):
